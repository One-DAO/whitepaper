# FAQ

### General

<details>

<summary>What is esports/fantasy esports?</summary>

Esports stands for “electronic sports” and most commonly refers to any video game title(s) with a competitive professional scene such as CS:GO, League of Legends, DOTA 2, Fortnite, etc.

Similar to fantasy football, fantasy esports is a way for fans to battle each other using teams comprised of their favorite players. The winner is determined by fantasy points accrued by their players’ stats in their professional matches.

<summary>How are we creating a metaverse?</summary>

Esports One is creating an interactive virtual map, that through the use of crypto tokens and utility-based NFTs, will elevate the experience of online gaming communities, competition, and esports fandom. This virtual map will consist of digital properties, called arenas, for communities of all backgrounds and goals to create, play, and grow.&#x20;

Dedicated arena owners can upgrade their land to acquire new features, more significant reward allocations, cosmetics, and other bonuses. We will also have game experiences within our metaverse, such as fantasy esports, predictions, game missions, and eventually other gaming/esport titles offered by partners and arena owners.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Why crypto and why now?</summary>

We have always prided ourselves on our fantasy platform, being “all-in-one” with everything you could want as a gamer or esports fan. Yet, we always ask our team, “What are we missing” or “How do we improve.” With the innovations of Web 3.0, we realized that crypto would also significantly improve the international user experience. Specifically, it comes to claiming prizes and earning rewards due to its instantaneous nature, global usage, and blockchain security. On top of that, we also recognized the importance of ownership for digital rewards/assets for gamers and fans.

Decentralized ownership will play a significant role in the future of gaming. We are working with our community, advisors, and legal team to establish a DAO that gives our community the power to build the metaverse they envision.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are we different?</summary>

We're not just creating another NFT collection. We're not just launching the next DAO. And we're not launching our own token with no utility.\
\
Instead, we're taking each of these pillars of web3 and combining them to form a true metaverse, fully decentralized, from day one.\
\
Our NFTs will be mutable, used to participate in experiences like fantasy esports. They will provide special access to holders.

Our token will incentivize and reward governance participation. It will be a mechanism that can be staked, earned, spent and redeemed. It will enable true vested interest from holders and investors alike.

Our DAO is the cornerstone of the platform. Enabled through the implementation of guilds, each with their own budgets, members and initiatives, with the primary goal of creating more value of the token.\
\
Each pillar is a monumental undertaking on it's own. But if done methodically and in conjunction with one another, they will be able to support the other and bring to life what will truly be the future of the metaverse.

<summary>What are the benefits of blockchain?</summary>

**Distributed Ledger Technology** All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the duplication of effort typical of traditional business networks.

**Immutable Records** No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after being recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.

**Smart Contracts** A [smart contract](glossary.md), like any contract, establishes the terms of an agreement. But unlike a traditional contract, a smart contract’s terms are executed as code running on a blockchain like Ethereum. Smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality — everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming.

</details>

### Metapass

<details>

<summary>What is a Metapass?</summary>

The Metapass is your passport into the esports and gaming metaverse built by Esports One. They are standalone access NFTs that will reward holders and unlock future in-game utility within the esports and gaming metaverse. In the same way that a passport allows travel from country to country, your Metapass will grant access to Arenas.

By holding a Metapass, you will receive exclusive benefits, including everything from arena giveaways, NFT presales, elevated Discord status, digital and in-person events, staking rewards, airdrops (tokens, player cards, partner collabs), and much more.

Additionally, owners of a Metapass will be the inaugural members of OneDAO, the governance and community-run organization that rewards members with tokens for actively participating in the ecosystem's growth.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How much do they cost?</summary>

During the mint you can claim Metapass Carbon & Gold for free, including the gas.

Metapass Standard is also free, except for the gas fees which should only be a few cents since the NFTs are being minted on Polygon.\


After mint they will be available on secondary exchanges.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where can I buy a Metapass?</summary>

The official collection on Opensea can be found here: [https://opensea.io/collection/metapass-genesis](https://opensea.io/collection/metapass-genesis)\
\
Be careful of fake/scam collections and only use the links provided by Esports One staff.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How many are available?</summary>

Each edition will only be available for claiming for a limited amount of time.

Metapass Carbon: 1,000\
Metapass Gold: 3,000\
Metapass Standard: Unlimited

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I sell my metapass?</summary>

Of course. But once you release your Metapass to someone else, all the benefits and access will transfer with it, including OneDAO and access to the Arena presale.

</details>

### Metarenas

<details>

<summary>What are Arenas?</summary>

Arenas are the foundation for building a thriving community within the metaverse. Each arena is an ERC-721 plot of digital real-estate that hosts gaming and esports-centric contests and events. Once an owner stakes an arena, they begin to receive regular allocations of tokens to incentivize active participation in their arena.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I get an arena?</summary>

Since there will only be 1,000 arenas during season one, we are building a reserve list of community members, partners, and influencers. Additionally, we will be running various giveaways and contests to secure an arena early. Your best chance is to pick up a Metapass Carbon prior to release.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do arena levels work?</summary>

As you stake your arena and participate within the ecosystem, your arena will accrue experience and levels—the higher your arena's level, the greater the rewards. This increases the value of your arena via custom cosmetics and access to new features and experiences.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where will arenas be minted?</summary>

The arenas will be minted and activated on our very own site.

</details>

### Tokenomics

<details>

<summary>What protocols are we using?</summary>

In addition to [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) and [ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/721), we're utilizing a new standard for our NFT assets, [ERC-1155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1155). This allows for the management of single and multiple token types and enables us to deploy contracts that include multiple tokens of the same type and a combination of fungible and non-fungible tokens.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the difference between each protocol?</summary>

### **ERC-20**

**$ESPORTS & $BYTE**

The token standard is used for creating and issuing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts can then be used to create a smart property or tokenized assets that people can invest in. ERC stands for "Ethereum request for comment," and the ERC20 standard was implemented in 2015.

They are used across the ecosystem by owners, managers, brands, and organizations. Allows for the exchange of ASSETS.

### **ERC-721**

#### **ASSETS**

An open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectibles. Ensures verifiable scarcity that allows token ownership to be tracked at the individual layer. Each asset has a UUID (Unique Identifier) and optional metadata.

Player cards and user avatars are considered to be assets.

### ERC-1155

#### **ARENAS**

The first token standard that allows users to mint fungible (identical) and non-fungible (unique) assets in a single, smart contract—enabling the creation of every type of asset, from digital currency to tokenized real estate up to gaming items and digital art.

ERC-1155 is the perfect protocol since it allows arenas to evolve, expand, and adapt as the ecosystem grows.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are $ARNA tokens?</summary>

The $ARNA token is our primary utility token and will be publicly available on third-party exchanges and directly from our website. Everything within the ecosystem is backed by $ARNA and used to incentivize staking, whether in the form of arenas or $ARNA tokens itself.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What are $BYTE tokens?</summary>

$BYTE are social tokens used to engage and grow your community. Users can earn $BYTE in several ways, both on Esports One and through 3rd party integrations. Users can spend BYTES in the marketplace on card packs, unlock access to events, purchase arena experiences, and tip other users and arena owners.&#x20;

Most importantly, $BYTE is our governance token and is rewarded to DAO participants.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does stake to play work?</summary>

Stake to play is our spin of "Play to Earn" and is how we promote shared ownership across the ecosystem.&#x20;

Users can "stake" in two different ways.

1. Arena Staking
2. Token Staking

Arena staking is how individual arenas are activated and provide owners with passive token allocations while incentivizing community building.

Token staking makes it easy for anyone to join our metaverse and experience all it offers. Traditionally, individuals are asked to pay or risk crypto to interact with a platform in the crypto world. In the esports metaverse, we use staking.

</details>

### OneDAO

<details>

<summary>What is a DAO?</summary>

The acronym is short for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization." In short, a DAO is an open-source blockchain protocol that is governed by rules set forth by its elected members. DAOs are a community of individuals who share a common interest (or many).

Establishing DAOs allows our community in the esports metaverse to decide future features for the roadmap, reward systems, invest in other projects or companies, and much more. DAOs are just the first step in supporting our community and the beginning of our platform being community-owned.

[Whiteboard Crypto: What is a DAO?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHm0uUPqmVE)

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the difference between the Community &#x26; Arena DAO?</summary>

**Arena DAO**\
Available only to staked arena owners. This allows holders of Arenas to govern themselves under the Community DAO and shape the future of all arenas.

**Community DAO** \
****Allows users who own and have staked $ESPORT to submit proposals and participate in the governance of the token and community. The Community DAO will be able to direct funds from the Community treasury as they see fit.

</details>

### NFT

<details>

<summary>How do we store files and images?</summary>

We are utilizing the [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) file-sharing system as it can be leveraged to store and share large files more efficiently. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can easily be stored on a blockchain. Nonetheless, IPFS does not permit users to share files with selected parties.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do we manage metadata?</summary>

Metadata connection uses IPFS URI.

* A Uniform Resource Identifier, or URI, specifies a particular piece of content in each context. The URI scheme determines the context (appended to the URI as a prefix, followed by ://). The URI scheme for IPFS is simply ipfs.
* IPFS URIs are the canonical representation for an IPFS link. The ipfs scheme makes it unambiguous that the CID (uniquely identifies a piece of content) refers to content on IPFS and not some other system.
* We use an IPFS URI to link from smart contracts to any external data stored using IPFS, including metadata that describes and contextualizes the token.
* IPFS URIs are also a way to link from within a token's metadata to images and other assets stored on IPFS.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Where can I buy and sell NFTs?</summary>

You will be able to buy and sell our NFTs directly from our marketplace using our tokens and ethereum. Additionally, NFTs will be accessible from 3rd party exchanges.

</details>

### Security/Legal

<details>

<summary>How are we preventing bots and hackers from disrupting the launch?</summary>

Wallets will be limited to only one Arena mint during the reserve list private sale. We will have users verify their wallets through Discord to help prevent bots. In terms of our smart contracts, our team of developers and advisors is confident in the contract structure. Additionally, we will have our smart contract audited by [CertiK](https://certik.com).

As always, a significant part of crypto-security is preventing silly mistakes. Only a few of our team will have access to announcement channels in Discord. Our Discord will have constant reminders to turn off private DMs, don’t click links outside of the #official-links channel, and more typical guards in place.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do we secure our wallets?</summary>

We minimize the responsibility of our hot wallets and limit them to referral and reserve lists. Other wallets are strictly cold storage and are responsible for updating the platform with new contracts and parameters.&#x20;

Cold wallets use 2 out of 3 [multi-signature wallets](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet), with owners of the multi-signatures being three hardware wallets.

The wallet can upgrade our ESPORT token and the ability to extend functionality.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do we ensure NFTs are minted securely?</summary>

All NFTs are created and uploaded to the IPFS, a peer-to-peer file transfer network secured by the blockchain and provides lifetime access to each token’s data. Only authorized users will be able to mint tokens, which includes creators. This allows for additional procedures to verify candidates for minting their own NFTs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is Esports One policies regarding copyright?</summary>

Our mission is to grow communities and operate with transparency as this is your platform. Due to the variety of NFT assets on our site, we have several policies:

* Arenas - Owners of arenas are free to use their NFT commercially.
* Player Cards - Due to cards having team copyrighted logos and player likeness, you are not permitted to commercialize Player Cards.
* Avatars - These are your representation of yourself in the esports metaverse, so you are free to use your Avatar as you wish.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How are we addressing the environmental concerns?</summary>

Initially, we planned on launching an NFT project in Summer 2021. Still, after our team researched the environmental impact of specific blockchains and consensus processes, we decided it would be best to wait till sustainable blockchain technology progressed even further. In the last several months, an explosion of innovation within crypto has led to more sustainable options like [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), a protocol that operates off of proof-of-stake, allowing for minimal energy usage and fast transactions while maintaining the security of proof-of-work consensus.

Additionally, 1% of all transactions will go towards conservation and environmental impact causes and charities.

Environmental impact is a top priority of ours, and we will regularly update our policies in the best interest of the environment.

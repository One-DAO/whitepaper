<details>

<summary>Address</summary>

The address is the identifier where a transaction is sent. The address is derived from a user’s public key. The public key is derived from the private key by asymmetric key cryptography. In Ethereum, the public key is 512 bits or 128 hexadecimal characters. The public key is hashed (i.e., uniquely represented) with a Keccak-256 algorithm, which transforms it into 256 bits or 64 hexadecimal characters. The last 40 hexadecimal characters are the public key. The public key usually carries the prefix “0x.” Also known as public address. Note: Keccak-256 does not follow the FIPS-202 based standard (a.k.a SHA-3).

Reserve List (formerly whitelist) has multiple meanings in a blockchain context. First, it may refer to a list compiled by a blockchain start-up to assess the legitimacy of potential investors — using identity verification and intended investment amounts — that want to participate in an upcoming funding round. Second, it may refer to when cryptocurrency exchanges or wallets ask a user to verify the authenticity of a withdrawal address by “whitelisting” the address. This is done to prevent the user from becoming a victim of fraudulent withdrawals from their wallet or exchange account by malicious actors.

<summary>Smart Contract</summary>

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the contract terms between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code. They run on the blockchain, so they are stored on a public database and cannot be changed. The transactions in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without a third party.&#x20;

Our smart contracts are used to mint and configure unique NFTs as well as tokens for our creators.

<details>

<summary>Staking</summary>

Staking is the process through which a blockchain network user 'stakes' or locks their cryptocurrency assets on a network as part of the consensus mechanism, thus ensuring the security and functionality of the chain. Staked assets are usually held in a validator node or crypto wallet, and in order to encourage staking most projects reward the holders of staked tokens with annualized financial returns, which are typically paid out on a regular basis. Staking is a core feature of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols, and each blockchain project which incorporates a staking feature has its own policies for staking requirements and withdrawal restrictions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Staked Incentive</summary>

A token balance held by a smart contract whose purpose is to influence user behavior. A staking reward is designed to encourage positive behavior by giving the user a bonus in their token balance based on the stake size.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Utility Token</summary>

A token that utilizes some functionality of a smart contract system or that has an intrinsic value defined by its respective smart contract system.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Wallet</summary>

Wallets can be digital (software) or physical (hardware), hot (connected to the internet) or cold (disconnected from the internet), custodial (a trusted third party has control of a user’s private keys) or non-custodial (only the user controls their private keys).

<summary>Web 1.0</summary>

Web 1.0 was initially launched in the early 1990s when the internet first began to enjoy mainstream adoption. Web 1.0 was primarily a static, read-only infrastructure which generally lacked the more expanded functionalities of Web 2.0. Web 1.0’s infrastructure was made up of many companies that were mostly unable to maintain their monopoly of the internet because they were replaced by more interactive, capable systems that became more widespread in the early 2000s. Today, many see a new evolution of the internet dawning, as blockchain systems seek to foster a more sophisticated, democratic, user-centric version of the internet: Web 3.0.

<details>

<summary>Web 2.0</summary>

The realization of Web 2.0 began in the early 2000’s. This second wave of internet innovation is characterized by its read-write and interactive design model. Platforms such as Amazon, Facebook, Airbnb, Alibaba, and Twitter led the charge in Web 2.0 development, offering dynamic and multi-functional application experiences across all our devices. However, many criticize Web 2.0 for being too centralized, and for paving a path toward excessive focus on profit, unreasonable advertising, mass surveillance, decreased privacy, and widespread data theft. In response, the Web 3.0 movement seeks to leverage blockchain technology to flip the Web 2.0 model on its head and link programs directly with each other.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Web 3.0</summary>

The term Web 3.0 refers to a vision of the third generation of computing, which anticipates that technologies like blockchain will decentralize the internet and disintermediate Web 2.0 companies like Facebook, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Apple to enable the online exchange of value, and allow users to own their data. Web 3.0 is designed to benefit all participants using a peer-to-peer (P2P) model for websites, applications, and the internet as a whole. It will focus in many ways, on producing a machine-readable data-driven semantic web. Many believe blockchain and crypto are central to the realization of the open, public, censorship-resistant, borderless, free internet: Web 3.0.

<summary>Whitepaper</summary>

A report-style document that explains a complex issue in relation to a specific industry or field, and discusses how an enterprise solves that problem. Whitepapers typically introduce a business model and development plan. In the context of blockchain, a whitepaper is one of the first documents that is created after a project has a working product and funding. It also acts as a pitch to new investors to help the company further their funding process. For blockchain-specific whitepapers, the technical architecture, token economics, team, and other data are also commonly outlined.

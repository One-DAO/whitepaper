Represents standalone utility NFTs that allow holders to earn rewards, unlock access and experience the future of web3 like never before.&#x20;

As a Metapass owner, you will receive exclusive benefits and perks, from arena giveaways, NFT presales, elevated Discord status, digital and in-person events, staking rewards, airdrops (tokens, player cards, partner collabs), and much more.&#x20;

Additionally, your Metapass grants access to the governance and community-run DAO. OneDAO receives a weekly allocation of tokens to reward members for actively participating in the ecosystemâ€™s growth.

### Editions

# Metapass

![](../.gitbook/assets/Metapass.png)

Represents standalone utility NFTs that allow holders to earn rewards, unlock access and experience the future of web3 like never before.&#x20;

As a Metapass owner, you will receive exclusive benefits and perks, from arena giveaways, NFT presales, elevated Discord status, digital and in-person events, staking rewards, airdrops (tokens, player cards, partner collabs), and much more.&#x20;

Additionally, your Metapass grants access to the governance and community-run DAO. OneDAO receives a weekly allocation of tokens used to reward members for actively participating in the ecosystemâ€™s growth.

### Editions

There will be three editions during Season One; Carbon, Gold, and Standard. One wallet can hold all three passes but benefits only accrue to the highest level of the pass that a wallet holds. For example, if you hold Carbon and Silver, you would receive the benefits from Carbon.

* Discord Role: Exclusive access to the OneDAO community run by full-time metaverse & esports enthusiasts, NFT traders and investors, and crypto influencers.
  * Our Discord will be providing: daily updates on the latest NFT drops, metaverse news, strategy write-ups, IRL meets, and more.
* 10% of all sales are distributed to the community fund that is used to benefit Metapass Carbon & Gold holders

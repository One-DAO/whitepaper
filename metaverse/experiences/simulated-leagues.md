# Esports Sim

What the primary constraint when playing fantasy esports/sports? **The match schedule.**

Using League of Legends LCS (North America) as an example: \
The pro teams play 2-3 times each week on the weekends (and sometimes Friday).&#x20;

So, let's say I set my fantasy lineup on Monday, I have to wait nearly 5 days to see any sort of "action" for how well I performed. This is a major issue when it comes to bringing DFS (Daily Fantasy) to the esports industry.&#x20;

In addition to the traditional fantasy esports experiences that will be available for all arenas, we are building the first _**Simulated Esports Leagues**_. If you've ever played a game like [Zed Run](https://zed.run), you may have an idea of where I'm going with this. And while you are partially right, we're thinking so much further than that.&#x20;

Every week.. no, day.. no, hour there will be different simulated matches where you can enter your lineup of players and teams, each with their own varying stats, bonuses, attributes, multipliers and of course rarity, and earn points based on how well they performed in that simulated contest.

### Our Unique Advantage

We've spent the past 4 years aggregating statistics on every match, team and player going back as far as 2010. This data is used to create predictive analysis and data models, fully enabled by machine learning that has calculated 10's of millions of professional, amateur and casual matches around the world.&#x20;

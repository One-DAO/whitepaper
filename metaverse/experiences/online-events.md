### Virtual Venues of the Metaverse

Arenas will become the interactive 3D locations for events and tournaments in the esports and gaming metaverse. Arena owners will have the freedom to use their space to host their communities' events and tournaments (for Fantasy/Web3 games) or can choose to lease this space to brands and other communities to run their own activations. In the future, Players in these communities can virtually walk around and interact inside the Arenas with their Esports Avatars.&#x20;

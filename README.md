# Summary

![Building the metaverse for esports and gaming, the right way.](<.gitbook/assets/Intro Slide>)

Esports One is building the future of the esports & gaming metaverse. By taking the concepts of community, competition, and fandom to the next level, we've create a unique virtual world with [digital arenas](metaverse/metarena.md), fully powered by our own utility tokens and mutable NFTs.

Arenas are owned by creators, brands, esports teams, and you, the community. You'll be able to host a variety of virtual events and [experiences](metaverse/experiences/), from [fantasy esports](metaverse/experiences/fantasy-esports.md) to [skill-based wagering](metaverse/experiences/skill-based.md) to the first [esports sim leagues](metaverse/experiences/simulated-leagues.md), all the while rewarding engagement with our own tokens. Users will leverage their knowledge of web 2 and web 3 games to collect a wide spectrum of NFTs, each with unique rarity and utility.

Our ARNA token is backed by digital collectibles that combine unique and familiar gamification mechanics all the while providing value and status based on fandom and skill, not chance. Users can stake their ARNA token to participate in arenas and compete for rewards based on how much and how long they've been staked. This ensures we can be fully focused on creating all new web 3 experiences that provide multiple forms of revenue for gamers and esports fans alike.

_**This is what it takes to be the metaverse that makes sense.**_

## Goals

To build a thriving community, we must create sustainable and value-added forms of engagement that incentivize active participation. This will be achieved by creating a crypto-enabled esports and gaming metaverse that benefits all users, not just a few, we can ensure a diverse and inclusive community of like-minded individuals.

To achieve this, we must create an on-ramp for shared ownership in the ecosystem that doesn't deviate from the underlying user experience.

### Our Focus

* Gamified fandom
* Building a 3D virtual interactive world
* Curating partnerships with brands, teams, and creators
* Accessibility into esports, crypto, and NFTs
* Sustainable and long-term value for $ARNA ownership
* Unlocking the true potential of NFTs

### We do this by...

* Building a clear and easy on-ramp into crypto and NFT's for creators, fans, and brands
* Creating and facilitating gamified virtual experiences and integrations that engage and reward players
* Establishing new and sustainable sources of revenue for any creator, big or small
* Supporting virtual and in-person engagement for esports fans around the world
* Monetizing through a shared ownership
* Bridging the gap between brands and creators

## Established Name in Esports & Gaming

Esports One began in 2017 to enhance the esports fan experience through stats and analytics. We spent the first year at MIT building an automated computer vision with semi-machine learning features capable of capturing and analyzing thousands of live-stream data points in real-time. We compiled and manipulated every team, player, and tournament data point we could find, going back as far as 2010. While the Esports One of 2017 (known initially as Esportsology) looks much different now than it did back then, our esports data has remained the backbone of who we are today.

In 2019, we shifted our focus towards doing what we love the most, building for the consumer that puts the community above anything else. This led to the creation of the first all-in-one fantasy platform built specifically for gamers.

Today, we're taking the next step in our journey and evolving Esports One to be fully decentralized and community-owned. We believe that this is the only path that can truly put the power of entertainment, fandom, and camaraderie into the users' hands.

# Our Ecosystem

Esports One stays with the user every step of their esports journey from fantasy to research. We reach them where they are at, whether they are looking for the next tournament to watch on Esportscalendar or going on a deep dive for the richest information about their favorite teams and players on Esportspedia. On top of this, our active community and expert analysts are always discussing various esports and competing in match predictions through our Discord Bot, OneBot, that we developed to drive conversation and elevate fans' viewing experiences.

## Discord OneBot

With more than 300 million users on Discord, we built the first esports bot that brings fantasy to where you hang out. [OneBot](https://top.gg/bot/533024429517570049) allows users to interact with their fantasy contests inside Discord, making it easy for friends or entire communities to play fantasy together. Users can check their  score, lineup points, rank, make predictions about pro matches, and receive notifications about their fantasy contests - while never leaving Discord.&#x20;

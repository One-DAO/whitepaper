# Our Team

Our team comprises longtime esports and crypto veterans, with our CEO, Matt, making his entry back in 2010 when he founded one of the largest League of Legends websites, Leaguepedia. After selling the company in 2014, Matt transitioned to running Product, Engineer, and Contest as one of the first employees at Curse Gaming, Azubu, and later Unikrn. He saw firsthand the lack of engaging fan experiences powered by real-time data and analytics. In 2017, he tackled this problem firsthand and founded Esports One. Using NFTs, computer vision, and historical + live data, we are reinventing the fantasy esports experience for gamers and fans worldwide.

Launched out of MIT in 2017, Esports One took a picks and shovels approach to the esports & gaming industry. Our real-time computer vision solution allowed us to automate data capture and circumvent API limitations. This solution made it possible to analyze and understand gameplay like never before, leading to what would be referred to as the yellow first-down line of esports.

Today we're disrupting the antiquated fantasy ecosystem while putting the power in the hands of the creators. Our token-economic model, enriched by dynamically evolving NFTs, provides new monetization opportunities that elevates fan engagement to all-new levels.

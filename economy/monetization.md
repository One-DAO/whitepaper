# Monetization

## Revenue Streams

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Revenue Flow.png>)

The $ESPORT token will provide immediate liquidity to players, creators, and investors, with the value ultimately being derived by the experiences built within our metaverse. Our focus on creating new business models in esports and gaming will set us apart from other platforms. We believe that fantasy is just the first layer of the esports metaverse.

## KPIs

We've defined a core set of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) that will play a significant part in the ecosystem's success. These variables that we're targeting will ensure we establish organic growth that empowers arena owners and their communities as well as individual managers. Each KPI includes its own set of date ranges (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)

* Player growth & retention
* Creator growth & retention
* Number of active arenas
* Number of fantasy contests
* Number of fantasy contest entries
* Arenas won
* Active NFT assets in circulation
* NFT assets minted and sold
* Average price of player cards by rarity

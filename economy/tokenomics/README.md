# Tokenomics

We're launching two tokens as the foundations of the esports metaverse economy. The first of these is our primary token, [$ARNA](esport.md), and can be bought, staked, earned, and sold while interacting on the platform. **xARNA** is our staking token for holders that stake their $ARNA

****[**BYTE**](byte.md) **** is a **utility token** spent to activate and upgrade arenas and can be earned through active participation on and off the platform and can't be purchased.
